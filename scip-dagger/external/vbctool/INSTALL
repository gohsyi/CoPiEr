INSTALLATION
===============================================================
1) Make sure you have a Motif-compatible library (e.g. lesstif)
   installed on your system where your compiler can find it.

2) Extract the content of vbctool-archive to a directory of 
   your choice.

3) Download the Motif-Application-Framework from the vbctool
   homepage and extract it into the subdirectory lib/

4) Go into the subdirectory lib and build all necessary
   libraries. This is done in the following way:

   First, enter the subdirectory

       cd lib

   Then, go into the subdirectory GFE and build the GFE lib:

       cd GFE
       make
       cd ..

   Build the TreeInterface lib:

       cd  GraphInterface
       make
       cd ..

   Finally, build the Motif Application Framework:

       cd MotifApp
       make
       cd ..

5) You are now ready to build the vbcTool! Go back to
   the main directory

   	cd ..

   and build:

   	make

6) You can now start the tool by typing 

	./vbctool

7) Enjoy!
