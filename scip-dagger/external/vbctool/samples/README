Example Files for the VBCTOOL - the Tree Interface Version 1.0

The files included in the example package are constructed in order
to demonstrate the abilities of the Tree Interface. Some of them
show the same tree, only they have different adaptions for the Tree 
Interface. The example files are listed and explained below.

gr_*    :   Simple trees with no information at every node. The number
	    in each filename depicts the numbers of nodes in the tree. 
	    Load a file and the tree will be drawn.
	    Load a tree with a large number of nodes. Choose "Area Zoom"
	    in the menue "View". Position the mouse cursor above the draw area.
	    Press the left mouse button and keep it pressed while opening the 
	    zoom rectangle. Release the button when the area is chosen.
	    Press the middle mouse button and keep it pressed while 
	    moving the cursor slowly over the draw area. This "drags" the
	    drawing.  

th_*    :   Simple trees with no information at every node. The files
	    are the input of the small demonstration of an Users Algorithm
	    that is adapted to the Tree Interface in our executable. 
	    Load a file and then click on the button "User Algorithm"
	    in the menue  "Algorithms". If the tree gets to small, click on 
	    the button "Scaler..." in the menue "Applications". Resize
	    the tree with the help of the "Scaler..." WHILE the algorithm is 
	    still running. All other applications can be handled as well 
	    as the "Scaler". 
	    
Infgr_* :   Trees including informations at every node.
	    Load a file and the tree will be drawn. Position the mouse cursor 
            above a node and click the right button: a node information window
	    will appear.
	    Try the bowser mode: Click on the button "Browser Mode" in the 
	    menue "Applications". Position the mouse cursor above the draw 
	    area, press the left mouse button and keep it pressed while 
	    moving it across the tree. Keep an eye on the left diplay area.
	    It shows the "important" information.

C_*     :   The same trees as stored in Infgr_*, with different colours
	    added for every node. Change colour or shape of the nodes 
	    with the menue "Nodes...". If a colour is not listed check 
	    paragraph 2.4.3.11 in the User Manual, how to list this colour.

Emul_*  :   Tree to demonstrate the use of the Emulation tool. 
	    "Start" the emulation. "Interrupt" it. Call the "Setup.." menue in
	    the menue "Emulation". Enter a time that the remaining emulation
	    should need. This time may be much longer or much shorter than 
	    the remaining time. "Continue" the Emulation.
	    After the emulation has stopped, call the "Setup..." menue again.
	    Choose single step or show complete tree. (Both are available
	    as well DURING the emulation process. Just interrupt the process 
	    and then continue it after making your choices in the setup.)
	    If "Single Step" was choosen, "Start Emulation" (or "Continue" it).
	    Then step through the emulation by hitting the space bar.
	    In case nothing happens, place the mouse cursor in the draw area
	    and click once the left mouse button.

pipe_*  :   Example output of ABACUS, that is piped into the Tree Interface.
	    By kind permission of Stefan Thienel.
	    Use the following syntax:
	             cat pipe_39 | vbctool	
	    Then click the button "Standard In" in the menue "Online".
	    Use all features of the Tree Interface while the output is 
	    still piped to the Tree Interface.
